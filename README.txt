Steps for running the code:
1.	Open the following files and check if the information present inside them is correct:
	info.php
	db_connect.php

2.	Credits for the new semester:
	Include the "odd2015.php" file in the CREDITS directory

Since EI branch is not available to all the semesters as of now, we need to consider it as IT itself.

Dept_average will not be calculated for EI branch and hence dept_avg entry for 1st year will be 0.

We should MANUALLY ENTER the average of the EI branch in place of IT branch for first year.
And also COMPLETE average for IT branch should also be updated accordingly.
