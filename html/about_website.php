			<br> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: underline;">What
				is Sjce Results?</span> <br> Sjce Results is a Results Search
			Engine. We aim to provide the most comprehensive results when you
			search for your result. Being a search engine we help users find
			information that is publicly available on the SJCE Website
			"http://sjcemysore.org/results.aspx". We do not own this information
			nor can we delete or modify it - we simply find and index what is
			publicly available to anyone on the Internet.<br> <br> This is a
			completely non-profit website. We do not display any advertisements
			on the website and do not gain any revenue as such. The only aim of
			the website is to help the students of SJCE search for their results.
			<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: underline;">How
				did Sjce Results obtain all this information?</span> <br> We search
			through the SJCE website and extracts names, grade, usn and other
			relevant information from the pages; this data is then processed and
			indexed so it can be searchable by anyone.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: underline;">Can
				I remove my information from the search results?</span> <br> If you
			prefer that a certain information will not be shown on
			sjceresults.com you should act to make the information on the source
			not publicly available by leaving a feedback.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: underline;">How
				accurate is the information?</span> <br> sjceresults.com does not
			verify the accuracy of the facts or the relevance of the data in each
			result; we merely cite publicly available information found on the
			source. Since no algorithm is perfect, some interpretation or
			processing errors are possible; we'll be happy to receive your
			feedback and will try to improve our system accordingly.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: underline;">What
				about privacy?</span> <br> Understanding the potential sensitivity
			of student's data makes privacy a very important issue for us, we
			only display information that is already available on public web
			pages in a publicly available form. If you have any additional
			questions or comments - please contact us on FB or mail us at
			sjceresults@gmail.com .
