DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING<br><br>

Started as an offshoot of Civil Engineering, a humble beginning was made in 1987 as Centre for Environmental Science and Technology (CEST) to promote and start a new programme in Environmental Engineering catering to the needs of the developing society. B.E. (Civil and Environmental Engineering) and M.Tech., (Environmental Engineering) with the financial support from CPHEEO, Ministry of Urban Development , Govt. of India, New Delhi were started under the umbrella of CEST. <br>
In the year 1993, the Govt. of Karnataka has accorded grant-in-aid status to the department and since then the Department of Environmental Engineering is working as a full-fledged academic and research department.<br>

Both Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programmes of Environmental Engineering have been accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) of AICTE, New Delhi.<br>

The Department has started a cross disciplinary Masters programme in Health Science and Water Engineering during 2009. This programme is an outcome of an international collaboration with Govt. of France.<br>

The Department has a blend of senior, highly qualified, dynamic and highly motivated faculty who have national and international exposure and expertise in their chosen areas of interest.<br>

The Department is well known in the State as well as in the country for its quality education being offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. <br>

The Alumni of the department have made a niche through their exemplary contributions for the companies they are working for. Most of them have realized their dreams of reaching higher echelons in their chosen career. <br>

The Alumni of the department have also established themselves as highly enterprising Entrepreneurs in the country.<br>
<br>
